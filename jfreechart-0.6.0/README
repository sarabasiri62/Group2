3.  DEPENDENCIES
JFreeChart requires JDK 1.2 or later.  In addition, it uses classes
from the JCommon class library (also available from
www.jrefinery.com), version 0.5.1 or later.  The JCommon jar file is
included in the JFreeChart download, but you may want to download
JCommon separately to obtain the full source code (also under the GNU

4. THE DEMO APPLICATION
There is a demonstration application included with JFreeChart.  To run
it you need the two files jfreechart.jar and jcommon.jar.  Using JDK
1.2.2 (or later) you can start the demo by running the class:

    com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo.

For example, on Linux, the following command line will run the demo
application:

java -classpath demo.jar:jfreechart.jar com.jrefinery.chart.demo.JFreeChartDemo

Depending on your system configuration and the current working
directory, you may need to specify paths in the above command line.
